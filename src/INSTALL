Installing the Isaac Genome Alignment Software
==============================================

Prerequisites:
--------------

- cmake (>=2.8.2)
- boost (>= 1_46_1)
- gcc (>= 4.6.1), for compilation
- CASAVA (>= 1.9.0a3)

The installation package will automatically build cmake and boost if the 
compatible versions are not found.

Quick start:
------------

iSAAC _must_ be built outside of the source directory. The steps are the usual
configure/make/make install. If you are only interested in running iSAAC
without CASAVA, or if the appropriate version of CASAVA is installed in
/usr/local/CASAVA/bin:

mkdir iSAAC-build
cd iSAAC-build
/path/to/iSAAC/src/configure --prefix=/path/to/iSAAC-install
make
make install

For additional options:

/path/to/iSAAC/src/configure --help

To enable the integration with CASAVA variant calling:

mkdir iSAAC-build
cd iSAAC-build
/path/to/iSAAC/src/configure --prefix=/path/to/iSAAC-install --with-casava=/path/to/CASAVA/bin
make
make install
